# Zero-ZeroGPT

## What is it?
This is a demonstration application. It showcases how replacing standard spaces with various Unicode space characters can affect the detection of AI-generated text by common AI detection tools like **GPTZero** and **ZeroGPT**.

## AI Detection Approach
Most tools designed to identify text generated by AI models use a few techniques to detect AI-generated content:

- **Pattern**: Detects unusual word choices, repetitive patterns, and syntactic structures
- **Linguistics**: Looks at grammatical structures, coherence, and context to measure inconsistencies.
- **Statistics**: Compares the statistical distribution of words and phrases to identify anomalies.

## Unicode Spacing
AI detection tools generally tokenize text based on standard spaces. By replacing these spaces with special inicode characters, it is possible to disrupt the tokenization process

### Tokenization and Prediction
1. **Tokenization**: Many detection models split text into tokens based on spaces. When unicode spaces are used, these tools will fail to recognize them as standard spaces.
2. **Statistics**: The statistical features of the text are changed when spaces are replaced with unicode spaces. This prevents the model from matching the text with its learned patterns.
3. **Patterns**: Unicode spaces can disrupt the detection model's ability to identify typical text patterns.
